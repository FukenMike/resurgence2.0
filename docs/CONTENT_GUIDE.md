Writing style, tone, and page patterns for The Father's Alliance website.

---

## Tone & Voice

The Father's Alliance speaks with a **clear, confident, grounded** voice that respects the real challenges families face while offering genuine hope and practical pathways.

### Core Principles

**1. Dignity Over Pity**
- Avoid language that implies shame or failure
- Never frame families as victims; frame them as resourceful people in temporary pressure
- ✓ "Families navigating real-world pressure"
- ✗ "Struggling families" or "At-risk households"

**2. Practical Over Flowery**
- Use concrete language; avoid abstract or overly emotional appeals
- Lead with what we *do* and *how it works*, not why we're moved to do it
- ✓ "We provide vehicle repair assistance to prevent transportation disruption"
- ✗ "We compassionately help families whose vehicles have betrayed them"

**3. Honest Over Overselling**
- Set clear boundaries about what we do (and don't do)
- Include explicit disclaimers where appropriate (legal advice, clinical services)
- Acknowledge what we don't solve and direct to proper resources
- ✓ "We do not provide legal advice; we connect families to legal resources"
- ✗ "We solve all legal problems"

**4. Direct Over Jargony**
- Use short sentences and active verbs
- Minimize nonprofit jargon; explain any necessary terms
- Speak to families, not just donors
- ✓ "Rent support when you need it fast"
- ✗ "Rapid-deployment stability mitigation via targeted micro-interventions"

**5. Calm Over Urgency-Hype**
- Crisis content is factual but grounded; avoid panic language
- Show competence through clear guidance, not frantic energy
- ✓ "Here's what to do if you're facing eviction: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3"
- ✗ "EMERGENCY: You could lose your home tomorrow!"

## Audience Tiers

Write for **three overlapping audiences** (in priority order):

### 1. Families (Primary)
- Who are they? Fathers, caregivers, households with rent/transportation/utilities pressure
- Language: Direct, actionable, hopeful
- Avoid: Donor/funding language, clinical terminology, long paragraphs
- Goals: Build trust, show how to access help, clarify process

### 2. Providers & Partners (Secondary)
- Who are they? Nonprofits, government agencies, case workers, service providers
- Language: Clear scope, network value, coordination mechanics
- Include: API/portal details (future), partnership criteria, outcome tracking
- Goals: Show how to integrate, what to expect, how to refer

### 3. Donors & Supporters (Tertiary)
- Who are they? Individuals, foundations, corporations, media
- Language: Impact metrics, outcomes, fiscal responsibility
- Include: Transparency page, annual reports, why the model works
- Goals: Build confidence in execution, show return-on-investment of support

## Writing Do's and Don'ts

### Do

✓ Use **active voice** — "We deliver support quickly" vs. "Support is delivered quickly"

✓ Lead with **benefit** — "Reduce eviction risk with emergency rent support" vs. "Our rent support program"

✓ Use **numbers and specifics** — "We serve families earning $25K–$75K/year" vs. "We serve working families"

✓ Include **clear next steps** — "Go to /crisis-navigation" vs. "Learn more"

✓ Break up text into **short paragraphs** (2–4 sentences max)

✓ Use **bullet points** for lists (scanning on mobile)

✓ Emphasize **outcomes** — "You'll stay housed and stable" vs. "We help with rent"

✓ Be **specific about boundaries** — "We don't provide legal advice; here's where to get it" vs. say nothing

### Don't

✗ Use **passive voice** — "Assistance is provided" (say "We provide assistance")

✗ Bury **key info in paragraphs** — Use headers and bullets

✗ Make **vague promises** — "We help people" (say "We provide rent support for 3 months while you find stable income")

✗ Use **nonprofit clichés** — "Transform lives," "Make a difference," "Empower," "Uplift" (these dilute meaning)

✗ Use **jargon without explanation** — "Service provision," "vulnerable populations," "holistic support"

✗ Assume **prior knowledge** — Explain FSIP, MSP, eligibility criteria, etc. clearly

✗ Mix **multiple CTAs** — One primary action per page (Get Involved, Apply Now, etc.)

## SEO & Meta Copy

Each page has a **title** (tab + search results) and **description** (search snippet).

**Rule**: Every description should answer *why this page matters*.

## Content Governance

### Where Does Copy Live?

**All site copy** lives in [src/content/siteCopy.ts](../src/content/siteCopy.ts).

This is intentional: separating content from components makes bulk edits easy, allows non-developers to update text, and keeps styling/structure separate from substance.

**To update text**:
1. Edit the relevant object in `siteCopy.ts` (e.g., `homeCopy.headline`)
2. No code changes needed; page auto-updates
3. Commit and PR

### Adding New Copy Sections

1. Add to `siteCopy.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const myPageCopy = {
     headline: '...',
     body: '...',
     // ...
   };
   ```

2. Import in page component:
   ```tsx
   import { myPageCopy } from '../content/siteCopy';
   ```

3. Use in JSX:
   ```tsx
   <h1>{myPageCopy.headline}</h1>
   ```

## Reviewing & Feedback

### Checklist Before Publishing

- [ ] Headline is active + benefit-focused
- [ ] No vague language (specify amounts, timelines, who)
- [ ] Clear boundaries stated (what we don't do)
- [ ] Links/CTAs are specific (not "click here")

---

## Examples

### ✓ Good Example (Home Page Subheadline)

> The Father's Alliance embodies the role fathers traditionally play: protection, guidance, responsibility, and support to help households stay steady. We provide supplemental, practical help to build families up when standard assistance is slow or out of reach so a short setback does not become a crisis.

**Why**: Specific, active, dignified, explains *why we do this*.

### ✗ Poor Example (Hypothetical)

> The Father's Alliance transforms lives by uplifting vulnerable populations through holistic support and empowerment initiatives to create systemic change.

**Why**: Vague jargon (transform, uplift, empower, systemic change), no concrete outcomes, unclear who we serve or what we do.

### ✓ Good Example (Resource Card Description)

> Community legal aid providing eviction defense, landlord-tenant mediation, and pro bono representation for families earning <200% poverty level. Covers all 50 states; some services limited to specific states.

**Why**: Specific services, clear eligibility, transparent scope.

### ✗ Poor Example (Hypothetical)

> Legal services for families in need.

**Why**: Vague—which services? Who qualifies? Where?
