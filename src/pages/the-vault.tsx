            <strong>Riven</strong> (adj.) — split or torn apart with force.
            <br /><br />
            Life taught him early—pain leaves marks, silence speaks louder than noise, and survival isn’t clean.
            But those scars gave him a voice—a steady whisper beneath chaos, and an unflinching gaze into truth most refuse to see.
            <br /><br />
            Iam Riven writes not from a desire to be heard, but because silence became impossible.
            Every word he chooses is deliberate, shaped by loss, resilience, and quiet rebellion against the comfort of ignorance.
            <br /><br />
            You won’t find him under bright lights. His words don’t care if you’re comfortable—they care that you’re awake.
