      <p className="mb-4">
        We don’t exist yet—not in the way they define existence.  
        We’re a flicker in the dark.  
        An idea.  
        A spark that hasn’t caught fire—<em>yet</em>.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We are not overlooked.  
        We are <strong>filtered out</strong> by design.  
        We are fathers buried under bureaucracy—  
        Flagged, disqualified, shut out of support systems not built for us.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We are not missing—we are <strong>excluded</strong>.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The Father’s Alliance is born from that truth.  
        From custody battles where children become property.  
        From courtrooms that reward conflict.  
        From systems that turn love into liability.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        They talk about helping families.  
        But families like mine are left out every time.  
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        There’s no help when you’re a father doing it alone.  
        No gas cards. No housing support. No margin for mistakes.  
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We’re expected to carry it all—  
        And blamed when we collapse under the weight.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        So we forged something new.  
        A presence. A pulse. A counterforce.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This is rebellion.  
        This is restoration.  
        This is the heartbeat of every father they tried to write out of the story.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-amber-400">
        We are not a whisper anymore.  
        <br />
        <strong>We are rising.</strong>
