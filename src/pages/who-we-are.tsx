        <p className="mb-4">
          We don’t exist yet—not in the way they define existence.  
          We’re a flicker in the dark.  
          An idea.  
          A spark that hasn’t caught fire—<em>yet</em>.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We are not overlooked.  
          We are <strong>filtered out</strong> by design.  
          We are fathers buried under bureaucracy—  
          Flagged, disqualified, shut out of support systems not built for us.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We are not missing—we are <strong>excluded</strong>.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Father’s Alliance is born from that truth.  
          From custody battles where children become property.  
          From courtrooms that reward conflict.  
          From systems that turn love into liability.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          They talk about helping families.  
          But families like mine are left out every time.  
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There’s no help when you’re a father doing it alone.  
          No gas cards. No housing support. No margin for mistakes.  
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We’re expected to carry it all—  
          And blamed when we collapse under the weight.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          So we forged something new.  
          A presence. A pulse. A counterforce.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This is rebellion.  
          This is restoration.  
          This is the heartbeat of every father they tried to write out of the story.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-amber-400">
          We are not a whisper anymore.  
          <br />
          <strong>We are rising.</strong>
