          Family law hasnâ€™t evolvedâ€”but families have. Divorce. Custody.
          Support. CPS. The process is brokenâ€”outdated, biased, and blind to the
          truth behind closed doors. It punishes pain. Profits from separation.
          And almost never reflects whatâ€™s best for the child.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fathers. Mothers. Guardiansâ€”we all face the fallout. This alliance was
          born from that fire. From courtrooms where voices are silenced,
          stories ignored, and justice feels optional.
        </p>

        <p>
          We rise from that silenceâ€”not to beg for change, but to build it.
          <br />
          <strong>We. Are. Rising.</strong>

          The Fatherâ€™s Alliance isnâ€™t a service providerâ€”not yet.
          Weâ€™re building something bigger: a parallel system for families
          buried by broken laws, biased courts, and bureaucratic silence.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-neutral-300">
          What you see here is the beginning of that rebellion. No grants.
          No handouts. No paid consultants. Just lived experience, raw truth,
          and a refusal to be erased.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-neutral-400 italic">
          If youâ€™ve ever been silenced, ignored, or broken by the systemâ€”this was
          built with you in mind. Not as charity. As a counterforce.
        </p>
