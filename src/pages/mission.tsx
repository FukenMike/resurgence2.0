    How the System Undermines Parents: What They Don’t Tell You
  </h2>

  <p className="mb-4">
    When your child is taken—especially across state lines—you enter a maze built to wear you down.
    Agencies like DHR, CPS, and DHHS claim to protect children, but what they actually do is sever families
    through a web of policies, power grabs, and red tape. Here's how it works:
  </p>

  <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-6 text-left text-lg leading-relaxed">
    <li>
      <strong>The Interstate Trap (ICPC):</strong> <br />
      The ICPC causes massive delays, denials, and disconnects. Even with custody, reunification across state lines is blocked
      until both states approve—often taking months or years. There’s no accountability, and even a valid custody order
      means nothing when a dependency case is active elsewhere.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The "Safety" Loophole:</strong> <br />
      Agencies throw around vague terms like “safety concerns” and “best interest of the child” to override court orders—
      often without proof. Parents are denied the ability to see full records or defend themselves. Safety Plans become traps.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Parental Alienation by the State:</strong> <br />
      Once your child is in care, the system rewrites the story. Visits get cut. Saying “I love you” becomes dangerous.
      If your child wants to stay—after weeks of manipulation—it’s used against you.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Services Used Against You:</strong> <br />
      Every step you take to get better becomes ammo. Rehab? Unstable. Therapy? You have “issues.” Two jobs? No time for your kid.
      The system twists progress into guilt.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The Funding Incentive:</strong> <br />
      States get paid to keep your child in care—through Title IV-E reimbursements and adoption bonuses. Reunification loses money.
      Removal and adoption generate revenue.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Your Rights? Optional.</strong> <br />
      You’re no longer presumed innocent. “Constructive abandonment” lets them terminate your rights through delays they caused.
      Judges rarely question the agency—even if another court already ruled in your favor.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>No Voice, No Recourse:</strong> <br />
      Speak up and you're “noncompliant.” Ask questions and you're “hostile.” Go public and they say you're “exploiting the child.”
      You're silenced—and your child may grow up thinking you abandoned them when you were fighting to be heard.
    </li>
  </ol>

    This is not just your story—it’s ours.

    We’re building The Father’s Alliance because this system doesn’t protect kids—it breaks families.
    If this sounds like your story, you’re not alone. And if it doesn’t? Trust us—you need to know how easy it is
    to become the next case.
  </p>
</div>

    <p className="mb-4 font-bold text-xl text-amber-400 tracking-wide uppercase">
  Our mission is to break the cycle.
</p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        To stand in the gap where the system fails—where trauma, poverty, addiction, and bureaucracy collide and leave families shattered in the rubble.
        We are here to stop the bleeding. To advocate for fathers, yes—but also for mothers, for children, for the people who fall through the cracks because the forms don’t fit their reality.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We believe families are the foundation of the future. And our children—<em>all of our children</em>—deserve more than broken homes, court battles, and untreated pain.
        They deserve love. Stability. Healing. They deserve a world where support shows up <em>before</em> the damage is done.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The Father’s Alliance exists to change the narrative.  
        To offer help with no judgment.  
        To restore dignity with no red tape.  
        To fill in the gaps no one else will touch—because real life doesn’t wait for approvals.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We fight for equal treatment in family law.  
        We fight for access to mental health care.  
        We fight for working brakes, running heaters, insulin, eyeglasses, warm beds, and full stomachs.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We fight for the right to survive with <em>grace</em>—not just barely hang on.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold">
        This is about more than fatherhood.  
        This is about people.  
        And it’s about time they had someone in their corner.
