      <p className="mb-4">
        Our mission is to break the cycle.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        To stand in the gap where the system fails—where trauma, poverty, addiction, and bureaucracy collide and leave families shattered in the rubble.
        We are here to stop the bleeding. To advocate for fathers, yes—but also for mothers, for children, for the people who fall through the cracks because the forms don’t fit their reality.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We believe families are the foundation of the future. And our children—<em>all of our children</em>—deserve more than broken homes, court battles, and untreated pain.
        They deserve love. Stability. Healing. They deserve a world where support shows up <em>before</em> the damage is done.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The Father’s Alliance exists to change the narrative.  
        To offer help with no judgment.  
        To restore dignity with no red tape.  
        To fill in the gaps no one else will touch—because real life doesn’t wait for approvals.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We fight for equal treatment in family law.  
        We fight for access to mental health care.  
        We fight for working brakes, running heaters, insulin, eyeglasses, warm beds, and full stomachs.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We fight for the right to survive with <em>grace</em>—not just barely hang on.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold">
        This is about more than fatherhood.  
        This is about people.  
        And it’s about time they had someone in their corner.
